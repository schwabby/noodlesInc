7/21 notes:
alignment issue with navigation:
When you make the 1200px media query, just make everthing fixed.
target the alignment for ios resolutions: 320, 480, 768, 1024, fuck the other devices :(
remove the cherry blossom and green banner between 500-700.
to the right of the facebook feed put "since 2013"
